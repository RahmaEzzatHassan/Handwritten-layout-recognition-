Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Handwritten-layout-recognition project (the "Project"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity ("Contributors"), Rahma and her Team ("Recipient") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Rahma and her Team; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

If you have not already done so, please complete and sign this Agreement and send it to [email]. Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.
